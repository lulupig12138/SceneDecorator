## ðŸŽ¬ Overview
In this work, we design a training-free framework called <b>SceneDecorator</b>, to address two key challenges in story generation: <i>scene planning</i> and <i>scene consistency</i>. SceneDecorator comprises two core techniques: (i) <i>VLM-Guided Scene Planning.</i> Leveraging a powerful Vision-Language Model (VLM) as a director, it decomposes user-provided themes into local scenes and story sub-prompts in a ''global-to-local'' manner. (ii) <i>Long-Term Scene-Sharing Attention.</i> By simultaneously integrating mask-guided scene injection, scene-sharing attention, and extrapolable noise blending, it maintains subject style diversity and long-term scene consistency in story generation.
Overall framework is shown below:
